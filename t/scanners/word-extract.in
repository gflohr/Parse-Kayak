There is, we are told, a curious contrivance in the serv- 
ice of the English marine. The ropes in use in the 
royal navy, from the largest to the smallest, are so 
twisted that a red thread runs through them from end 
to end, which can not be extracted without undoing the 
whole; and by which the smallest pieces may be recog- 
nized as belonging to the crown. 

Just so is there drawn through Ottilie's diary a thread 
of attachment and affection which connects it all to- 
gether, and characterizes the whole. And thus these re- 
marks, these observations, these extracted sentences, and 
whatever else it may contain, were, to the writer, of pe- 
culiar meaning. Even the few separate pieces which we 
select and transcribe will sufficiently explain our meaning.
