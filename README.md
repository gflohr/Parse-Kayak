# Parse-Wisent

Wisent is a compiler compiler for Perl.  It includes both a lexer (`wlex`) and
parser generator (`wisent`) designed to work together.

## Description

The suite of programs in this module can be thought of as the Perl equivalent
of GNU bison resp. yacc and Flex resp. lex but for Perl.  Both programs are
designed to work together.

## Status

Pre-alpha, work in progress.
